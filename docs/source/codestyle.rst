Code style and standards
========================

*When developing on this project, please configure your IDE to adhere to the following guidelines.*

The code in this repository should be `PEP8 coding style guide <https://pep8.org/>`_ compliant, with one exception: maximum line length. 
`PEP8 specifies a maximum line length of 79 characters <https://pep8.org/#maximum-line-length>`_, a relic of a time where widescreen monitors didn't exist. In this project, we extend the maximum line length to 120 characters.

Furthermore, code documentation in this project should follow the `Numpy docstring format as detailed here. <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_

Finally, every Python module in this project should include an Apache License v2.0 statement at the top:
